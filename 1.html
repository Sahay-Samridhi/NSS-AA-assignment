<p> Hey there!! Myself Samridhi Sahay, a freshie (p.s not for long!!) from the electrical engineering (dual degree) department. I'm basically from Ranchi, Jharkhand but have experienced life in different parts of the country.I joined Educational Outreach in NSS under NOCS, although it was not the compulsory activity but my passion for social service which compelled me to do so.
In 1st semester I worked under Vidya and currently I'm in VFP.I love teaching, as it not just supports others but also englightens my mind, gives me experience and develops a healthy mental state.</p>

<p> For web designing purpose, I have learnt html and css in school for three years and designed web pages and web sites for school projects. Although a little brushing up is required as it has been too long since I have studied these topics but I'll try my level best to design the nss website user-friendly,interactive,attractive and inclusive of all useful information. I'm very dedicated towards this work as I have a lot of interest in learing and working on web designing so I would surely be completing every task with all my heart. </p>

<p class="none"> Thank You!! </p>
